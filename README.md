*I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ULTA IN ANYWAY*. This was a fun little project email template from Ulta that I did to brush up on my HTML and CSS skills.

Let me being by saying this project was by far the most difficult project I've had ever done so far.  Non-stop buggy mess that made me want to pull my hair out.  Making HTML emails isn't a joke.  However, I've learned alot while trying to play around with this project.  
## Optimizations

Where do I even begin with this one....  The biggest I had with this one is that the social media icons aren't centered when viewed in mobile.  If the content is viewed on a desktop email, the email appears to be fine to view, however, when viewed on a mobile device,
the white social media icons are noticeably off centered.  Should this be revisted (I need a long break from this), that is what is needed to be fixed.

Additionally, the logo on the email disappears when I tried to host it to be a viewable website. It's there when I email myself, but hosting it on the website... it just disappears. Additionally, I have to do a work-around method when hosting it on netlify since implementing it via github gave me a 404.  I honestly have no idea why. I tried for hours trying to figure it out but I find myself spending too much time on something I don't even understand how to fix.

I somehow managed to make it all work as of 5/26/2023.. fingers crossed.



## Lessons Learned:

HTML email templates are no joke.  A lot of styling is done via inline and on the same html page. Additionally, images need to be hosted on the web for them to appear (https://postimages.org/) is what I used to upload the images.  To my knowledge (correct me if I'm wrong), I couldn't find
a way to have the images be included in the emails unless it's been uploaded to the web.  Having it in local file will load up everything fine, but when I sent a test email, it would appear blank.

https://putsmail.com/ is the website I used to send myself the test emails to preview this work.
