Let me being by saying this project was by far the most difficult I've had ever done so far.  Making HTML emails isn't a joke.  However, I've learned alot while trying to play around with this project.  
## Optimizations

The biggest I had with this one is that the social media tags aren't centered when viewed in mobile.  If the content is viewed on a desktop email, the email appears to be fine to view, however, when viewed on a mobile device,
the white social media icons are noticeably off centered.  Should this be revisted (I need a long break from this), that is what is needed to be fixed.



## Lessons Learned:

HTML email templates are no joke.  A lot of styling is done via inline and on the same html page. Additionally, images need to be hosted on the web for them to appear (https://postimages.org/) is what I used to upload the images.  To my knowledge (correct me if I'm wrong), I couldn't find
a way to have the images be included in the emails unless it's been uploaded to the web.  Having it in local file will load up everything fine, but when I sent a test email, it would appear blank.

https://putsmail.com/ is the website I used to send myself the test emails to preview this work.
